# VBA-Challenge

Background: 
We used two similar datasets to properly develop and test a VBA script to help sort through Stock Market information. The first file is called Alphabetical Testing and was used to help develop the script, and test it prior to running it on our actual dataset called StockMarketAnalysis. This is simply due to the dataset in Alphabetical Testing being much smaller and easier to run through quickly. 

Solution: 
Our solution is to loop through all the sheets in both files simultaneously using our script. Below are what we wanted to get, and the results of such are in images included in this repository. 

Ticker Solution: 
The script will sort the distinct symbols each company is known by in column "I" with the name "Ticker".

Yearly Change solution: 
The column "J" has been populated with the results of our script finding the difference in starting value at the beginning of the year and ending value for the end of the year. Additionally, conditional formatting has been applied to properly indicate negative changes in red, and positive changes in green. 

Percent Change solution:
We also had the script helps us identify the percent change in opening price and closing price for the beginning of the year to end of year. This populates column "K".

Total Stock Volume solution: 
Each companies total stock volume is populated within column "L". 

Greatest % increase, decrease, and total volume solution: 
Finally, we developed our script to help us determine which company had the greatest % increase per year, decrease per year, and total volume. Columns "N", "O", and "P" are each populated with the column name, ticker name, and value for us.
